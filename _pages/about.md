I'm a Computer Science PhD Student at [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/).
My research interests are focused on image re-identification and retrieval in real world scenarios that experience challenges such as data scarcity and pose variations. 
My research is used to build deep neural networks on limited data for applications in ecology and wildlife conservation.

I received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia in 2009 and the M.S. degree in information systems from Queensland Central University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016. 
At QUT, I have been tutoring Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence for undergraduate and master students.
