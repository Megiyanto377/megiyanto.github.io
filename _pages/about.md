I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in Computer Vision.  

I conduct research as a Computer Science PhD Candidate at [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/), Australia. My research is in the field of computer vision with the focus on deep learning with limited annotated data. I have presented [my research](https://olgamoskvyak.github.io/publications/) at major computer vision conferences.

My passion is creating real business applications powered by machine learning. I have experience in [building and deploying](https://olgamoskvyak.github.io/portfolio/02-reid/) deep neural networks for applications in wildlife conservation.  

Prior to returning to research from industry, I worked in several consulting firms as a SAP ERP consultant from 2009 to 2014. I hold the B.S. degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia in 2009 and the M.S. degree in information systems from Queensland Central University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016.
