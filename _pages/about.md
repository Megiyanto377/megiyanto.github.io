I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon specializing in Computer Vision. 

I received a PhD degree at [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/), Australia in 2021.Â My research is in the field of computer vision with the focus on deep learning with limited annotated data. I have presented [my research](https://olgamoskvyak.github.io/publications/) at major computer vision conferences.

My passion is creating real business applications powered by machine learning. I have experience in building and deploying deep neural networks for applications in [wildlife conservation](https://olgamoskvyak.github.io/portfolio/).  

Prior to returning to research from industry, I worked in several consulting firms as a SAP ERP consultant from 2009 to 2014. I hold the B.S. degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia in 2009 and the M.S. degree in information systems from Queensland Central University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016.
