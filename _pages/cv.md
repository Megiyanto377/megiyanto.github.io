======

I am a Computer Science PhD Researcher at QUT Centre for Robotics, Australia.
I am expected to finish by the end of 2021. 
Currently I am interning as an Applied Scientist at Amazon.

My research is in the field of computer vision with the focus on deep learning with limited annotated data.
I am passionite applying machine learning for real-life applications.
My research has been used to build and deploy deep neural networks for applications in wildlife conservation.
