The aim of the project is to detect object-aligned bounding box based on axis-aligned bounding box. 
Axis-aligned bounding box is a common output of object detection methods.
Due to large variations in poses of animals in images especially for underwater images, axis-aligned box is not sufficient for furhter analysis of the detected animal, e.g. identification of specific individual.

The method is generic and not species specific. The same model architecture and training schedule are applied to seven species including turtles, manta rays, whale sharks, right whales and sea horses.

The project is completed for [WildMe/WildBook](https://www.wildme.org) based on their data.
