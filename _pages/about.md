Olga is currently a Computer Science PhD Student at [QUT Centre for Robotics](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/), Brisbane, Australia. Her research is in the field of computer vision with the focus on deep learning with limited annotated data for image retrieval and re-identification tasks. Her work aims to improve identification of objects in images by its visual appearance (pedestrians, vehicles, animals) under changing camera viewpoints. 

She has presented [her research](https://olgamoskvyak.github.io/publications/) at major computer vision conferences. Her research has been used to [build and deploy](https://olgamoskvyak.github.io/portfolio/02-reid/) deep neural networks on limited data for applications in ecology and wildlife conservation. 

Prior to returning to research from industry, she worked in several consulting firms as a SAP ERP consultant from 2009 to 2014. She holds the B.S. degree in mathematics from Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia in 2009 and the M.S. degree in information systems from Queensland Central University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia in 2016.
